### Software Cloning Examples

As a part of my B.Tech Mini Project, I created clones of two Java projects:
  * Car Sales System  <http://projectabstracts.com/1798/simple-car-sales-system-in-java.html>
  * Hotel Management System  <http://sourceforge.net/p/hotelmgmtsys/code/HEAD/tree/>

For the above codes, clones of Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4 were manually created and are present in the repository.
