Title: Car Sales System
Description: This program is a simple car sales system, you can add cars with details such as kilometers travelled, price, manufacturer, model, and additional info. Stores the cars using good OO design. 
The program uses swing and is a GUI application.
On exit the cars are saved to a data file named cars.dat in the same directory as the program. Next time the program is loaded it reads the data file and loads in all the cars. Serialisation is used for the reading and saving of the binary file.
This program was for a university assignment. It's been graded so hopefully there is no problem with releasing it. It will hopefully teach a lot of things, like swing, awt events, layout managers, swing events, simple menu's, JDialog's, using JTabbedPane.
It features a simple sorting algorithm which sorts strings in alphabetical order, and has an example of how you can invoke a method inside a object with only a reference to a object, and not knowing what class it belongs to. It's an alternative to using an interface i suppose.
Teaches serialisation also, which is basically saving the contents of an entire object in a data file, which can easily be read back into the object next time the program is loaded.
Code is commented using javadoc standards.
